A mod for [Project Zomboid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid) that aims to improve and explicit the moodles descriptions to make sure players know exactly what they are getting into.

Contributions are always welcome! Feel free to make a PR to add new languages or to fix anything.
Make sure:
- Your file has 174 quotation marks (assuming it translates all existing moodles including unused ones).
- It is reccomended that you try it in game first before making a PR.
- Files have special file encoding as every language needs it to show it off properly but gitattributes should deal with it.
